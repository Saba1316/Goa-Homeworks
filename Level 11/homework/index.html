                    A video game console is an electronic device that outputs a video signal or image to display a video game that can be played with a game controller. 
                    These may be home consoles, which are generally placed in a permanent location connected to a television or other display devices and controlled with a separate game controller, 
                    or handheld consoles, which include their own display unit and controller functions built into the unit and which can be played anywhere. 
                    Hybrid consoles combine elements of both home and handheld consoles.<br>

                    Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. 
                    The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, 
                    and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
