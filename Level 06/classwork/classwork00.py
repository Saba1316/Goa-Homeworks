dog_name1 = "Rick"

dog_name2 = "John"
dog_name2 = "Max"

print("First dog's name is" + " " + dog_name1 + ". " + "Second dog's name is" + " " + dog_name2 + ".")

print(f"First dog's name is {dog_name1}. Second dog's name is {dog_name2}.")

# In this code I used three best practices: Snake_Case,f-str,comments

# in this code, we first declared the variables and then concatenated those names to form a sentence





# task 2: Create 2 variables, num1 and num2, input both numbers as user and output their sum


num1 = int(input("enter the first number: "))
num2 =int(input("enter the second number: "))


print(num1 + num2)
