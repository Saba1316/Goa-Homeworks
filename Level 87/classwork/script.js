// Explain what a promise is

// A promise in programming, particularly in JavaScript, is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. 
// Essentially, it allows you to work with asynchronous code in a more manageable way than using traditional callbacks.

// In JavaScript, asynchronous operations (like fetching data from an API, reading a file, or performing any operation that takes time) 
// can take some time to complete. This can create problems if you're trying to run subsequent code that 
// depends on the result of the asynchronous operation, because JavaScript is single-threaded and it can't just "wait" for the operation to finish.


// Promises provide a powerful way to deal with asynchronous operations, making code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to debug. They enable developers to chain operations, 
// handle errors effectively, and build applications that can handle long-running tasks like network requests or file processing without blocking the main thread.
