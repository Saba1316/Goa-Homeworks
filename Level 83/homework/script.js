// Find a little information about javascript modules

// JavaScript modules are a way of organizing and structuring your 
// code into separate files, which can then be imported and exported as 
// needed. This helps keep your codebase more manageable, reusable, and easier to maintain.


// 1. Why Use JavaScript Modules in Your Code?
// a. Code Reusability:
// One of the key reasons to use modules is to enable code reusability. Instead of rewriting the same functions 
// across multiple files, you can place common logic in a module, then import it wherever it’s needed. This reduces redundancy and increases maintainability.

// JavaScript modules are essential for building modern, maintainable, and scalable applications. By organizing your code into s
// eparate files and importing/exporting functionality, you can improve reusability, maintainability, and performance. However, 
// to maximize the benefits of modules, it’s important to follow best practices such as keeping modules small and focused, avoiding circular 
// dependencies, and using tools to optimize your code for production.

// Whether you’re building small web applications or large-scale enterprise systems, understanding how to write, 
// structure, and manage JavaScript modules will be critical to your success as a developer.
