# task 1: Discuss what happened in this code, which best practices we used, write comments and explain why these best practices were needed

dog_name1 = "Rick"
dog_name2 = "John"
dog_name3 = "Max"


print("First dog's name is" + " " + dog_name1 + ". " + "Second dog's name is" + " " + dog_name2 + ".")


# In this code I used two best practices: Snake_Case, Case Sensitivity

# These best practices were necessary for the computer to read this code as soon as possible and understandably

# And in this code, we first declared the variables and then concatenated those names to form a sentence
