# task 1: Discuss what happened in this code, which best practices we used, write comments and explain why these best practices were needed

dog_name1 = "Rick"
dog_name2 = "John"
dog_name3 = "Max"


print("First dog's name is" + " " + dog_name1 + ". " + "Second dog's name is" + " " + dog_name2 + ".")


# In this code I used two best practices: Snake_Case, Case Sensitivity

# These best practices were necessary for the computer to read this code as soon as possible and understandably

# And in this code, we first declared the variables and then concatenated those names to form a sentence



# task 2: Make an example of 5 f strings, use big sentences, and include numbers as well.

sentence3 = f"Girl's weight is {girl_weight}. Boy's weight is {boy_weight}."

sentence4 = f"Girl's favourite color is {girlfav_color}. Boy's favourite color is {boyfav_color}"
