# task 2:  Recall the best practices learned today and explain why we use each one (snake_case, case-sensitiveness, comments)

user_age = 20
# Snake_Case is a name in which each space is replaced by an underscore and words are written in lowercase letters

name = "Saba"
print("Name")
# Case sensitivity means that uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different. in this case "name" and "Name" are considered two different variables.

score = 100    # I declared an integer type variable named score and assigned it the value 100.

# Comments are used to describe or characterize our code.
