# task 2:  Recall the best practices learned today and explain why we use each one (snake_case, case-sensitiveness, comments)

user_age = 20
# Snake_Case is a name in which each space is replaced by an underscore and words are written in lowercase letters

name = "Saba"
print(Name)
# Case sensitive is when all words are either lowercase or uppercase so that the computer can recognize it.
# comments are used to describe or characterize our code
