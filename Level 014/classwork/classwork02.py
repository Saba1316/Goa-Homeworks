# Task 3: Do the first two tasks again, but this time use negative indices.

# First let's declare a list. 

# Now let's insert 5 elements in it.
nums = [13,16,17,25,29]

# Now let's extract all the values form the list one by one.

print(nums[-5]) # 13
print(nums[-4]) # 16
print(nums[-3]) # 17
print(nums[-2]) # 25
print(nums[-1]) # 29  



nums = [13,16,17,25,29]

# At first let's replace second and last element.

nums[-5] = "Football"
nums[-1] = "Chess"

# Now at second let's output the modified list.

print(nums)

# The end of task 3
