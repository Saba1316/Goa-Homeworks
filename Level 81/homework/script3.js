// Explain how Inheritance and super functions work

// Inheritance is a concept where a class (called a child class or subclass) inherits properties and methods from another class 
// (called a parent class or superclass). This allows the child class to reuse the code from the parent class without having to rewrite it. In JavaScript, 
// inheritance is implemented through the extends keyword.

// In a simple scenario, a child class can:

// Inherit the properties and methods of the parent class.
// Override methods of the parent class to implement its own version.
// Add new properties or methods specific to the child class.

// Inheritance allows a child class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class, promoting code reuse.
// super() is used to:
// Call the parent class constructor to initialize inherited properties.
// Call a method from the parent class inside the child class's methods.
