# Explain this code

def spin_words(sentence):
     return " ".join([w[::-1] if len(w) >= 5 else w for w in sentence.split()])

# This code defines a function called spin_words that processes a given sentence. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

# Function Definition:

# The function is defined with the name spin_words and takes one parameter called sentence.
# Splitting the Sentence:

# sentence.split() breaks the input string into a list of words, using whitespace as the delimiter.
# List Comprehension:

# The code uses a list comprehension to iterate through each word w in the list of words created by sentence.split().
# For each word:
# It checks if the length of the word (len(w)) is 5 or more.
# If it is, the word is reversed using slicing (w[::-1]).
# If it’s shorter than 5 characters, the original word is kept as is.
# Joining the Words:

# After processing the words, join() is called on a space string (" ") to concatenate the words back together into a single string, with spaces in between.
# Return Statement:

# The final processed sentence is returned.
