# Explain with comments what is the use of try/except.

# A Try-Except statement is a code block that allows your program to take alternative actions in case an error occurs.

# Python will first attempt to execute the code in the try statement (code block 1). 
# If no exception occurs, the except statement is skipped and the execution of the try statement is finished.
