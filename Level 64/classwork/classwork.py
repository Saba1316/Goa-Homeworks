# Explain the difference between instance method (the same regular method) and class method

# In Python, both instance methods (also called regular methods) 
# and class methods are used to define behavior within a class, but they differ in terms of how they interact with the class and its instances.

# Instance methods are used for operations on individual instances of a class, while class methods are used for operations on the class itself or for factory methods that create instances.
