                who primarily use their feet to propel a <b><u>ball</u></b> around a rectangular field called a <b><u>pitch</u></b>. The objective of the game is to <b><u>score</u></b> more goals than the opposing team by moving 
                the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed <b><u>goal</u></b> defended by the opposing team. 
                Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. 
                With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.

            <h2>Top 5 football players of all time</h2>

            <h3>1.Lionel Messi</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Lionel Messi (Argentina) - 802 goals, 42 trophies</b>
                Emerging from Barcelona’s academy La Masia, Lionel Messi quickly became one of the best players in football, 
                winning his first Ballon d’Or in 2009 at the age of 22. He went on to win seven of them. He won the coveted treble twice with Barcelona and finally ended his wait for 
                a major international trophy with the Copa America 2021 and then added the FIFA World Cup 2022 trophy to his haul, 
                which also includes an Olympic gold medal from Beijing 2008. He is also the only player in history to win two Golden Balls in World Cups (2014 and 2022).
                Now in the twilight of his career, the Argentinian legend is now playing in the United States with Inter Miami. 
                In his short time in Miami, he has made an impact by helping the franchise win the Leagues Cup which is the first ever in the history of the franchise.
                While the Miami outfit is yet to establish itself as a powerhouse in the MLS, many fans of the team and neutrals alike are confident that it is only a matter of 
                time until the team starts competing for the 
                MLS title with the addition of Messi to the squad.
