// Find information about the Document Object Model and explain what it is

// The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents, primarily used in web development to manipulate and interact with HTML or XML documents. 
// It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to a part of the document (like an element, an attribute, or text).
