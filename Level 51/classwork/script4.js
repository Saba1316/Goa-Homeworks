// Q: Will this code throw an error? why
// let num = 5;
// let num = 6;

// Yes, the code will throw an error.

// In JavaScript, when you use the let keyword to declare a variable, you cannot declare the same variable more than once within the same scope.
// The second line (let num = 6;) will cause a SyntaxError, because you are trying to declare the variable num again in the same scope
