# Step-by-Step Execution
# Splitting the Sentence
# Input: "This sentence is a sentence"
# arr = ["This", "sentence", "is", "a", "sentence"]
# Processing Each Word
# "This" → Length < 5 → Stays "This"
# "sentence" → Length ≥ 5 → Reversed "ecnetnes"
# "is" → Length < 5 → Stays "is"
# "a" → Length < 5 → Stays "a"
# "sentence" → Length ≥ 5 → Reversed "ecnetnes"
# Joining the Words
# Final output:
# "This ecnetnes is a ecnetnes"
# Correct Answer
# "This ecnetnes is a ecnetnes" (Marked correctly in the image)
