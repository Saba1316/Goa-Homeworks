# Analyzing the code

# Step 1: Understanding the Function Definition
# def balance(left, right):
# The function balance takes two string inputs: left and right.
# Step 2: Weight Dictionary
#     weight = {
#         "!": 2,
#         "?": 3
#     }
# This dictionary assigns weights to two specific characters:
# "!" has a weight of 2

# "?" has a weight of 3
# Step 3: Initializing Counters
#     count1 = 0
#     count2 = 0
# count1 will store the total weight of the left string.
# count2 will store the total weight of the right string.
# Step 4: Calculating Left Side Weight
#     for i in left:
#         count1 += weight[i]
# Iterates through each character in left and adds its corresponding weight to count1.
# Step 5: Calculating Right Side Weight
#     for i in right:
#         count2 += weight[i]
# Iterates through each character in right and adds its corresponding weight to count2.
# Step 6: Comparing the Weights
#     if count1 == count2:
#         return "Balance"
#     elif count1 > count2:
#         return "Left"
#     else:
#         return "Right" or "Hakuna matata"
# If count1 (left weight) is equal to count2 (right weight), it returns "Balance".
# If count1 is greater, it returns "Left".
# Otherwise, it returns "Right" or "Hakuna matata".
# Note: The expression "Right" or "Hakuna matata" will always evaluate to "Right" because "Right" is a non-empty string, and in Python, the or operator returns the first truthy value.
# Step 7: Evaluating balance("!!!?", "?!!!!")
# Left Side Calculation ("!!!?")
# "!" appears 3 times → 3 * 2 = 6
# "?" appears 1 time → 1 * 3 = 3
# Total left weight = 6 + 3 = 9
# Right Side Calculation ("?!!!!")
# "?" appears 1 time → 1 * 3 = 3
# "!" appears 4 times → 4 * 2 = 8
# Total right weight = 3 + 8 = 11
# Since 9 < 11, the function will return "Right".
# Step 8: Answer in the Quiz
# From the image, we see that the correct answer selected is "Right", which matches our calculation.
# Thus, the function will output:
# Right
