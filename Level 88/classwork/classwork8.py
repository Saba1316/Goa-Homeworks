# Step-by-Step Execution
# Processing the Input "Indivisibilities"
# Convert to lowercase:
# "indivisibilities"
# Counting Duplicate Characters
# 'i' appears 7 times → Added
# 'n' appears 1 time → Ignored
# 'd' appears 1 time → Ignored
# 'v' appears 1 time → Ignored
# 's' appears 2 times → Added
# 'b' appears 1 time → Ignored
# 'l' appears 1 time → Ignored
# 't' appears 2 times → Added
# Unique characters in listn: {'i', 's', 't'}
# Final Output
# Length of {'i', 's', 't'} = 3
# Correct Answer
# "2" (Marked correctly in the image)
