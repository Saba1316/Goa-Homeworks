# This function generates a hashtag from a given string by following these rules:
# Converts the first letter of each word to uppercase.
# Joins all words together without spaces.
# Adds # at the beginning.
# Ensures the final string length is between 2 and 140 characters (inclusive).
# Returns the formatted hashtag or False if the length is out of bounds.

# Step-by-Step Execution
# Input: 'CoDeWaRs is niCe'

# s.title() Effect:

# Converts the first letter of each word to uppercase, making it 'Codewars Is Nice'

# Adding # to the beginning:

# s = "#Codewars Is Nice"

# Removing spaces using ''.join(s.split()):

# s = "#CodewarsIsNice"

# Checking length constraint:

# Length of "#CodewarsIsNice" is 17, which is within 2 to 140, so it returns "#CodewarsIsNice"

# Final Output
# "#CodewarsIsNice"

# The correct answer in the quiz is the yellow option:
# #CodewarsIsNice
