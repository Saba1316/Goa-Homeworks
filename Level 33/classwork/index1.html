<!-- Explain the role of sub-property justify-content (also talk about values). -->

<!--
 The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around 
 content items along the main axis of a flex container and the inline axis of grid and multicol containers.
-->

<!-- Values! -->
<!-- 
    The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally). 
    Main and the most useful justify-content values are flex-start, flex-end, flex-center, space-between, space-around.
