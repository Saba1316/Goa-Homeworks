# Task 2: Do the first two tasks again, but this time use negative indices.

# First let's declare a list. 

nums = [13, 16, 17, 25, 29]

# Now let's print all the values form the list one by one.

print(nums[-5]) 
print(nums[-4]) 
print(nums[-3]) 
print(nums[-2]) 
print(nums[-1])  


nums = [13, 16, 17, 25, 29]

# At first let's replace second and last element.

nums[-4] = "Football"
nums[-1] = "Chess"

# Now at second let's output the modified list.

print(nums)

# The end of task 2.
