        <h1>Top 5 Programming languages</h1>
        
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
            Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
            object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.<br>
            Python was invented in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, 
            which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.
            It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.<br>
            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
            In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
            That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. 
            In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, 
            and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
            It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
            The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, 
            it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web.[12] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, 
            which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.
