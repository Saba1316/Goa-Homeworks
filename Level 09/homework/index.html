        <h1>Top 5 Programming languages</h1>
        
        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
            Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
            object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.<br>
            Python was invented in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, 
            which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.
            It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.<br>
            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.
            In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.
            That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. 
            In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, 
            and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
            It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
            The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, 
            it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web.[12] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, 
            which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.

        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>
            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
            It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
            <br>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.[21] Java was originally designed for interactive television, 
            but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.[22] The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. 
            Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[23] Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.

        <h2>Swift</h2>
        <p>
            The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift), legally S.W.I.F.T. SC, is a cooperative established in 1973 in Belgium (French: Société Coopérative) and owned by the banks and other member firms that use its service. 
            SWIFT provides the main messaging network through which international payments are initiated. It also sells software and services to financial institutions, mostly for use on its proprietary "SWIFTNet",
            and assigns ISO 9362 Business Identifier Codes (BICs), popularly known as "Swift codes".<br>Before SWIFT's establishment, international financial transactions were communicated over Telex, a public system involving manual writing and reading of messages.
            SWIFT was set up out of fear of what might happen if a single private and fully American entity controlled global financial flows – which before was First National City Bank (FNCB) 
            of New York – later Citibank. In response to FNCB's protocol, FNCB's competitors in the US and Europe pushed an alternative 
            "messaging system that could replace the public providers and speed up the payment process".
