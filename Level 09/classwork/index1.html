<!-- task 2: As a comment, explain in your own words the difference between the <b> and <strong> tags and the <i> and <em> tags.-->

<!-- 
Unlike the <b> tag, which is primarily used for stylistic purposes to apply bold formatting, the <strong> tag carries semantic meaning.
Both <i> and <em> are used to make the word or phrase italic, but <em> also carries semantic meaning.
Correct use of semantic tags improves the accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
