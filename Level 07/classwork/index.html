<h2>Early Life and Career</h2> 

<p>Lionel Messi was born in a poor Argentine family. His father worked in a steel factory, and his mother was a part-time cleaner. Coached by his father, Messi started to develop a genuine interest in football from the age of five. He wanted to join the professional football team early, so he joined a local football club, Newell Old Boys Club.</p>

<p>However, his dream shattered when it was found that he had Growth Hormone Deficiency Syndrome, and needed $900 a month for treatment purposes and no local football club at the time could afford to sponsor his treatment.</p>
