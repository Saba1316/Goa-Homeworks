        <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
        <p>
            Lionel Messi was born in a poor Argentine family. His father worked in a steel factory, and his mother was a part-time cleaner. 
            Coached by his father, Messi started to develop a genuine interest in football from the age of five. 
            He wanted to join the professional football team early, so he joined a local football club, Newell Old Boys Club.

            However, his dream shattered when it was found that he had Growth Hormone Deficiency Syndrome, 
            and needed $900 a month for treatment purposes and no local football club at the time could afford to sponsor his treatment.
