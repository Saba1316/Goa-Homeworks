# Task 4: Play with these two loops, do 5 for loop examples and 5 while loop examples (something you haven't done before).

# First let's start with 5 for loops

# 1 
for y in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(y)

# 2
for i in range(2, 6):
  print(i)

# 3
for i in range(1000):
    print("Goa is the best")

# 4
club_name = "Real Madrid"
for letter in club_name:
    print(letter)

# 5
for y in range(999):
    print(y)
    print("Hello World")
