// Explain in your own words what Scope is


// In programming, scope refers to the context in which variables, functions, and objects are accessible or "visible" in your code. It determines where a 
// variable or function can be used or referenced and how long it lasts. Think of it like a boundary or a set of rules that define where certain pieces of data can be accessed.

// In simple terms, scope is like a set of 
// "rules" that dictate where variables and functions can be accessed or modified. Understanding scope helps you write cleaner, more organized, and less error-prone code.
