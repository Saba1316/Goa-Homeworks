// Talk about ES6


// ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015) is a major update to the JavaScript language that introduced many new features to improve code readability, maintainability, and functionality.


// Before ES6, JavaScript was often referred to as a "scripting" language and was seen as lacking in certain features that would make it suitable for building large-scale 
// applications. The arrival of ES6 addressed many of the gaps and shortcomings of the language, helping developers write more efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.

// ES6 brought major improvements to 
// JavaScript, making it more powerful, readable, and maintainable. These features have become widely adopted and are now an essential part of modern JavaScript development.

// ES6 wasn’t just a language update—it was a revolution that changed the way we write JavaScript. By introducing modern syntax, improving performance, and laying the groundwork for 
// future features, ES6 made JavaScript more powerful, user-friendly, and accessible. It’s not just a "set of features," but a new paradigm for JavaScript development.
