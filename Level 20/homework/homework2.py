# Task 2: Create 2 int variables and output their division, then explain why it outputs float and what is the name of this convert (implicit or explicit).

num1 = 100
num2 = 5

print(num1 / num2)

# It outputs float because Integer division gives the answer in whole numbers (the division result is rounded to the nearest whole number).And it's implicit.
