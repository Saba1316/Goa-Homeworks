                    in the conquered territories and threatened the Georgian people with physical destruction, noble feudal lords often disobeyed the king,
                    the authority of the king of Georgia did not extend to the east of the Likhi ridge.[6]During his thirty-six-year rule, Davit Aghmashenebeli

                    economic and cultural progress of feudal Georgia. Georgia at the time of David had wide-scale political and cultural relations with the North Caucasus
