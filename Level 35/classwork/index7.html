<!-- Write the difference between relative and absolute -->

<!-- 
    Relative to its Normal Position: An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to where it would normally be in the document flow. 
    This means it retains its space in the document, and its position can be adjusted using the top, right, bottom, and left properties. 
-->

<!--
    Relative to Nearest Positioned Ancestor: An element with position: absolute; is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor 
    (an ancestor with position other than static). If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
